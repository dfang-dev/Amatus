# Amatus
This project is in the alpha stage, very early development. Please let me know any suggestions you may have.

## Reference
This project is inspired by:

-- "Neuro-Sama" created by Vedal.

-- "Amadeus" from the fiction "Steins;Gate"

## Introduction
Amatus is a real time, fully responsive AI powered by Ollama. It is built with Python and is hosted locally, designed to retain memory of conversations.

Amatus will take the form of a 3D rendered model which includes facial expressions and lip syncing.

My goal is to make a virtual connection feel "human-like". Through this project I hope to help people overcome their speaking limitations through speaking to Amatus, and slowly gain confidence in communicating with others!
